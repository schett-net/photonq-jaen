Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<p>PhotonQ uses single photon polarization qubits as the substrate upon which quantum computing circuits are implemented. For this purpose a highly entangled state is prepared and each of their qubits are measured at carefully chosen bases. The measurement act affects the state of the entangled qubits. The basis of each measurement is selected such that the measurement results contain the statistics that allow us to return to each user the result of the requested quantum computation.</p><p>Since we use light, the end point of the polarization qubit measurement apparatus consists of a single photon detector module. Nevertheless, counting the number of photons arriving at each detector is not enough for our computational purposes. In order to perform a quantum computation using the one-way model we need a resource state. To prepare the highly entangled resource state required we need to look for specific events: 4-fold coincidence detection of single photons. PhotonQ provides the user with raw 4-fold coincides data taken directly from the laboratory single photon detectors. Moreover, the user interface provides controls that allow PhotonQ users to pick any custom basis for their measurements at the output of the encoded circuit to implement. At the laboratory back-end, PhotonQ handled the instructions to be sent to the hardware in order to perform the requested computation including the custom measurements provided by the user. At the laboratory, PhotonQ takes care of seeking for the required 4-fold coincidences allowing the user of our system to work directly with the quantum circuit implemented, i.e. without needing to consider the full photonic setup behind it. Once the coincidences statistics are obtained, the result is sent back to the user who can post-process the raw experimental data and, by doing so, obtain the result of the quantum circuit.</p><h2><strong>Encoded qubit measurements</strong></h2><p>By using PhotonQ any user can implement one-way encoded quantum circuits and obtain experimental data from the execution of these circuits. PhotonQ takes care of all the controls needed to perform the measurement based quantum computation. The user deals directly with the encoded circuit qubits, not with the physical qubits to be measured for the computation to take place. Consequently, at PhotonQ user interface (UI) we provide capabilities for custom measurements to be performed upon the encoded qubits at the output of the quantum computing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/4a0dd726b8d1f566fcfc161bf3a092b9817ca922-1458x883.jpg\"></p><p>As can bee seen in the figure above, there are four qubits in a linear cluster state used to perform the circuit depicted. Since PhotonQ takes care of the measurements that perform the one-way computation, at the Qubit Measurement (QM) module we can only see controls for the measurement of two encoded qubits. This pair of qubits are in the state as it would result from the presented circuit, as stated by the one-way model for quantum computing. Users can select any custom basis to perform the encoded qubit measurements. The measurement gadgets represented at the bottom right circuit figure, work each one as a two channel polarization detector, i.e. each one performs two projective measurements using the E state provided by the user in the QM module and its orthogonal state. PhotonQ extracts statistics of all the combinations possible between all the detection channels. For example, for the circuit implemented in the figure above where the user picks angle the values presented (45° for alpha, 90° for beta) at the QM module, the result of the computation will return all combination results between the two detectors, i.e. 00, 01, 10 and 11. Using polarization labels that would correspond to HH, HV, VH and VV.</p><p>The histogram can look like this, for example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://osg.snek.at/storage/BQACAgQAAxkDAAISJGMZw9-keXZGpV6xLUHt1FB0zjf3AALhDAAClLDRUAOx2z84vTAbKQQ\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to plot your own results with our ready-made script, you can simply use our binder at the following link:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zilkf92/PhotonQ-postprocessing/main?labpath=probabilities-histogram.ipynb\">https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zilkf92/PhotonQ-postprocessing/main?labpath=probabilities-histogram.ipynb</a></p>"}},"IMA:ChoiceField":{"category":{"props":{"name":"category","defaultValue":"All","options":["Beginner","Advanced","All"]},"value":"Beginner"}}},"jaenPageMetadata":{"title":"Your Circuit Results","isBlogPost":null,"image":"https://osg.snek.at/storage/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ","description":null,"datePublished":null,"canonical":null},"jaenFiles":[{"id":"f4c7020c-6465-592a-a5d7-be12b8c12387","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"backgroundColor":"transparent","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/6bf8e/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/27b10/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.jpg 750w,\n/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/6bf8e/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.jpg 847w","sizes":"(min-width: 847px) 847px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/0ce31/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.avif 750w,\n/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/f7c3b/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.avif 847w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 847px) 847px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/5edd4/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.webp 750w,\n/static/9ded757de3c767047fa01563184767bc/e9488/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITJ2NEMFs5g3qKfJoCTBuBjWgXRqUMAALxDQACO-ghUqtqQnqxDcMBKgQ.webp 847w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 847px) 847px, 100vw"}]},"width":847,"height":848}}}],"sections":[]}},"pageContext":{"jaenPageId":"JaenPage fb63df4e-61d6-4311-bd35-18a637a88bd8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2022418099","2766476970","2854131132","3369865175","3753378917","55007266"]}
