Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<h2><strong>An alternative computational model for quantum computing</strong></h2><p>The one-way model is an alternative computational model to the standard circuit model of quantum computation.

We basically distinguish between two types of measurements.</p><ul><li>Measurements in the <i>computational basis</i>:</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/b078d4a1b24e11fffa005aa609b8d3dddac6799c-351x57.png\"></p><p>These measurements have the effect of removing physical qubits from the cluster.

The choice of the measurement basis determines the logical quantum gates that are implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Feed-forward error correction</strong></h2><p>We already know that the measurement process in quantum mechanics delivers probabilistic results. For measurements in the equatorial basis, we therefore get the state <strong>|α&gt;</strong> with <strong>p(α)</strong> and the state <strong>|-α&gt;</strong> with <strong>p(-α)</strong>.<br><br>We define our computation in such a way that in the case of <strong>|α&gt;</strong> we can proceed with the computation as desired, and in the case of <strong>|-α&gt;</strong> the calculation has to be corrected with a well-defined operation. These probabilistically occurring errors can be completely corrected by <i>feed-forward control</i> of subsequent measurement bases.<br><br>Highly entangled cluster states, single qubit measurements, and classical feed-forward therefore allow for universal and deterministic quantum computation in the one-way model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p>To better understand the model, we also need to distinguish between physical qubits (which make up the cluster state) and encoded qubits (which logically perform quantum computation). It is best if we look at a few examples.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Linear cluster</strong></h4><p>The underlying structure of the linear cluster state is, as the name suggests: linear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/4050773fa1a4ce7ee7c0432cf9176973d1b93ac6-691x124.png\"></p><p>On this cluster, by measuring physical <strong>qubit 1</strong> in basis <strong>B(α)</strong>, then physical <strong>qubit 2</strong> in basis <strong>B(β)</strong>, and then physical <strong>qubit 3 </strong>in basis <strong>B(γ)</strong>, we logically perform three <strong>rotations around the z-axis</strong> followed by an <strong>H gate</strong>:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/ae2565fac309a06c41a85e0090b5b6f4512a506e-625x24.png\"></p><p>With the identity from above, the following quantum circuit, in particular an arbitrary single qubit rotation, can be implemented:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/5038c72838c97844df1e0cc6a06b472a896ec3c8-616x55.png\"></p><p>The state of the logically encoded qubit is then read out by measuring physical <strong>qubit 4</strong>, which is shown in the graph with a <strong>\"meter\" symbol</strong>.</p><h4><strong>Example 2: Horseshoe cluster</strong></h4><p>The underlying structure of the Horseshoe Cluster is also linear, or chain like. This is the same physical 4-qubit state as in Example 1 and in Ciampini's graph (see above). The difference to Example 1 are the measurements carried out.<br><br>In example 1, three measurements in the equatorial basis implement the logic and one measurement in the computational basis measures the final state.<br><br>In the horseshoe configuration, we only measure <strong>qubits 3 and 2</strong> in the equatorial bases <strong>B(β) and B(α)</strong> respectively. Computational basis measurements on qubit 1 and qubit 4 then measure the 2-qubit state of the remaining two physical qubits. So in this case, <strong>qubit 1 and qubit 4</strong> are our <strong>read-out qubits</strong> - compared to example 1, where only qubit 4 is our read-out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/3f4a794b6b1951bb3901107b29cd71bf27a22b9d-291x366.png\"></p><p>The translation into quantum circuits can be carried out analogously to example 1. There are two <strong>rotations around the z-axis</strong>, each followed by an <strong>H gate</strong> on two logically encoded qubits. The horizontal lines of the cluster represent the encoded (logical) qubits. Vertical lines between physical qubits represent <strong>CPHASE</strong> operations between the logical qubits. Together with the measurements on physical qubits 1 and 4 we thus implement the following quantum circuit:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/f15665d523371e233c072ac167e16bc48ee780a9-436x135.png\"></p><h4><strong>Example 3: Star cluster</strong></h4><p>The star cluster differs in the underlying structure from examples 1 and 2 above. Instead of a chain-like structure, the topology here is star-shaped. As a result, this physical state differs from those previously mentioned.<br><br>In the star cluster configuration shown below, <strong>qubits 1, 3, and 4</strong> are our <strong>read-outs</strong>, and on <strong>qubit 2</strong> we perform a measurement in the <strong>equatorial basis</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/2a8c49c60543c85339845d31c0398362404cb4c0-341x514.png\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this we implement a quantum circuit with three logic qubits. The circuit consists of two <strong>CPHASE </strong>operations and a <strong>z-axis rotation</strong> plus <strong>H gate</strong> on the second logic qubit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/c0a49b1b8a50485cd02642c06f038690d96c1e63-510x207.png\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Summarized</strong></h2><p>The one-way model is a universal model for quantum computation that allows us to execute quantum circuits just by measuring single qubits of an entangled cluster state. With feed-forward, the computation can even be carried out in a deterministic manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2><p>If you want to read in more detail, we recommend the papers by</p><ul><li>Raussendorf, R., &amp; Briegel, H.
