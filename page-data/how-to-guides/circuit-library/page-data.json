Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<p>PhotonQ implements the one-way quantum computing model to perform quantum computations. In the one-way model a resource state serves as the substrate upon which multiple quantum circuits can be implemented. PhotonQ uses single photon polarization qubits as the physical platform upon which highly entangled resource states are prepared.</p><p>In the one-way model, each resource state has a corresponding set of quantum circuits which it can implement. PhotonQ offers two 4-qubit highly entangled states as resource states:</p><ul><li>the 4-qubit linear cluster (L4) state and</li><li>the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.</li></ul><p>The qubits of these resource states are measured at a specific basis in order to encode the result of a circuit through the measurement process itself.</p><p>The <strong>circuit library</strong> (CL) is formed by the full set of circuits that PhotonQ can implement on its resource states; the L4 and GHZ states. Each entry in the circuit library has an unique identifier called “circuit id” (cID). Each cID has a corresponding set of experimental instructions to be loaded on PhotonQ hardware.</p><p>In order to distinguish between the polarization qubits that are prepared in a resource state and the qubits from the encoded circuit implemented using the one way model we name them physical and encoded qubits, respectively. We talk about encoded qubits when we refer to the qubits associated with circuits. We talk about physical qubits when we refer to the ones of the resource state.</p><p>While the CL contains all accessible circuits its ultimate functionality is to serve as a resource for hardware instructions for PhotonQ. In addition to instructions for the implementations of circuits, within the CL there are entries corresponding to special cases where the instructions to be provided to PhotonQ hardware does not have a corresponding circuit. In these special cases the one-way functionality is inactive. For more information about these cases see “PhotonQ with One-way functionalities off” guide.</p><p>In the following sections we present all the entries of the circuit library with a corresponding quantum circuit.</p><h2><strong>Encoded circuits with 2 physical qubits</strong></h2><p>The L4 qubit state can have its dimensions reduced from four to two by performing measurements on two of qubits. As a result, PhotonQ can operate one-way computations using a 2-qubit linear cluster (L2) state as a resource state. In the following section we introduce all circuits PhotonQ implements using the L2 state.</p><h2><strong>L2 resource state circuits</strong></h2><p>Following the circuit construction rules of the one-way model for quantum computing we can rearrange a L2 state in two different configurations. Each configuration can be portrayed as a graph where each vertex corresponds to a physical qubit while each edge to the entanglement between them. The one-way computing model is then implemented by measuring in order from left to right. Using the graph representation we present the two different configurations available for the L2 state.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/55a7407accc400eba1653d04dfcd1c4d9f5a3a1e-148x346.jpg\"></p><h3><strong>L2-Circuits with 1 encoded qubit</strong></h3><h4><strong>Circuit ID = 5</strong></h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/89383eeb3a2be35af9c15a8f74c1401f438c1431-152x149.jpg\"></p><p>The only configuration in which the L2 state produces a circuit with only one encoded qubit occurs when we line up all qubits in a horizontal straight line.

In this configuration one of the encoded qubits passes through a rotation around the Z axis gate and by a Hadamard gate in that order. Then, the encoded qubit that outputs the Hadamard gate passes through two CZ gates, one with each of the other two encoded qubits left. The corresponding circuit is presented below.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/87392f29fba384e3d9a7fc151a3e714a0aed864b-398x130.jpg\"></p>"}},"IMA:ChoiceField":{"category":{"props":{"name":"category","defaultValue":"All","options":["Beginner","Advanced","All"]},"value":"Advanced"}}},"jaenPageMetadata":{"title":"The PhotonQ Circuit Library","isBlogPost":null,"image":null,"description":null,"datePublished":null,"canonical":null},"jaenFiles":[{"id":"b672b9f3-4290-5f83-8836-1962d2f369c9","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"backgroundColor":"transparent","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/094bd/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/b0d36/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.jpg 750w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/f2a21/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.jpg 1080w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/a7bcc/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.jpg 1366w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/094bd/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.jpg 1516w","sizes":"(min-width: 1516px) 1516px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/aea6f/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.avif 750w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/33455/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.avif 1080w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/7a422/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.avif 1366w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/95d4a/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.avif 1516w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1516px) 1516px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/92aff/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.webp 750w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/0e0f3/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.webp 1080w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/08d39/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.webp 1366w,\n/static/2a4ece86d6243f1543ada70721f09b4a/f7172/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyWMRG2-A47smCPqlg3npb1SCX8YUAAJ2DQACax-IUPioE7Jc1bYrKQQ.webp 1516w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1516px) 1516px, 100vw"}]},"width":1516,"height":300}}}],"sections":[]}},"pageContext":{"jaenPageId":"JaenPage 5ffb2f2b-4009-40a1-a25b-e505e99be228"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2022418099","2766476970","2854131132","3369865175","3753378917","55007266"]}
