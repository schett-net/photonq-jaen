Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<p>PhotonQ operates using the one-way model for quantum computing. As stated by its name, our system uses single photons as the physical system upon which qubits are encoded. In particular, we exploit the polarisation degree of freedom of individual photons as the substrate upon which measurements will perform a quantum computation.</p><p>We can divide PhotonQ experimental setup into four different stages from the single photon generation to their detection. These four stages through which each photon used for quantum computing passes through are known as: the source, the demultiplexer, the cluster state preparation and detection module.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Source</strong></h2><p>Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in optical microcavities have allowed the generation of bright and high quality single photon sources. PhotonQ first module is in charge of the production of pure and indistinguishable single photons. These photons are used to implement the polarisation qubits upon which measurements will take place using the one-way model to perform a quantum computation.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Demultiplexer</strong></h2><p>After photons are produced at the source, we need to redirect these photons into different optical paths. PhotonQ operates producing high entangled states and to do so it requires single photons to be sent into beam-splitters at different inputs such that they interfere. Our source prepares single photons coming one one after the other and following the same path. In order to redistribute these photons into different paths a demultiplexer optical setup is used. The demultiplexing process relies on the use of a single electro-optic modulator which actively redirects photons passed through it into four different optical paths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Cluster state preparation</strong></h2><p>Once we have four optical paths filled with single photons coming one after the other it is time to make them interfere. The one-way model of quantum computing relies on the use of highly entangled states that serve as resources to implement quantum circuits. These also called resource states are produced by making photons interfere with beamsplitters while selecting those cases that lead to the desired resource state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Detection</strong></h2><p>With the resource state prepared all that is left is to measure each of these qubits to perform a quantum computation. In order to measure the polarisation degrees of freedom of individual photons we used a measurement apparatus formed by waveplates, a polarising beam splitter (PBS) and single photon detectors. The implementation of the right measurement to be performed takes place by rotation of the waveplates and therefore altering the projective measurements done by the PBS together with the single photon detectors. PhotonQ takes care of mapping the user-provided input to be implemented into the right projective measurements into the detection module. One these are set, photons start to be collected and detectors provide us with the statistics to return the resource of the targeted quantum computation.</p>"}},"IMA:ChoiceField":{"category":{"props":{"name":"category","defaultValue":"All","options":["Beginner","Advanced","All"]},"value":"Advanced"}}},"jaenPageMetadata":{"title":"Experiment","isBlogPost":null,"image":null,"description":null,"datePublished":null,"canonical":null},"jaenFiles":[{"id":"54e981b5-b6bf-5813-a278-e3c733d92698","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"backgroundColor":"transparent","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/b9f68/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.jpg","srcSet":"/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/6d39d/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.jpg 750w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/df0e7/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.jpg 1080w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/aaac0/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.jpg 1366w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/b9f68/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.jpg 1492w","sizes":"(min-width: 1492px) 1492px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/14fbd/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.avif 750w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/a368e/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.avif 1080w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/73330/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.avif 1366w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/08706/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.avif 1492w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1492px) 1492px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/96eaa/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.webp 750w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/5cff3/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.webp 1080w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/d8dcb/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.webp 1366w,\n/static/583da98839b5631989dd8efe9e4025ff/df799/BQACAgQAAxkDAAIRyGMRG2sm8lEZzhaRiSK5uKMcS3hAAAJ1DQACax-IUCjU763jFEDLKQQ.webp 1492w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1492px) 1492px, 100vw"}]},"width":1492,"height":300}}}],"sections":[]}},"pageContext":{"jaenPageId":"JaenPage c5181847-a586-44d6-a672-4d671afb26de"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2022418099","2766476970","2854131132","3369865175","3753378917","55007266"]}
