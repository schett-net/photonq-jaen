Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<h2><strong>PhotonQ user interface</strong></h2><p>In this section we present an overview of the PhotonQ user interface (UI) and how it allows a user to use our photonic quantum computer.</p><p>In order to perform a quantum computation, PhotonQ uses the one-way model. In this quantum computing model, a highly entangled state is prepared and serves as a resource to implement a specific quantum circuit. This state known as the ‘resource state’ can be configured to implement different circuits depending on the order we measure the individual qubits of the system and on the way we interpret our results. PhotonQ UI offers controls to the photonic hardware behind PhotonQ that allow the user to perform any computation from the library of circuits we provide.</p><p>PhotonQ UI controls have been designed according to both the one-way computing model and the physical system that serves as a substrate for the quantum computation, i.e. photons. <strong>The UI is divided into a sequence of five modules associated with different parts of the experimental hardware behind PhotonQ and with the one-way computing model implemented on it.</strong></p><p>According to the nature of PhotonQ, the first module corresponds to the single photon source feeding our optical setup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Source</strong></h2><p>The first step to build a photonic quantum computer like PhotonQ is to produce single photons. The single photon source used in PhotonQ is based on semiconductor quantum dots embedded in micropillar optical cavities. This type of solid-state emitter is kept within a cryostat at around 4 Kelvin such that, when excited with a pulsed laser it produces indistinguishable single photons that are collected and redirected further into PhotonQ setup. The source module displays six indicators associated with the single photon source.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/ae9ac25c918402905cf81205fd105b241451d9da-695x203.jpg\"></p><p>The Source module indicators assess the correct operation of the single photon source which ensures the quality of the prepared quantum states. The parameters under display are</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>Wavelength:</i> Produced single photon wavelength. PhotonQ operates with ~925 nm photons.</li><li><i>Single photon rate:</i> Frequency at which single photons are produced.</li><li><i>Brightness:</i> Single photon source brightness. Typical operation values lie around 16 MHz.</li><li><i>Purity:</i> Produced single photons purity. Typical operation values lie above 95 %.</li><li><i>Indistinguishability:</i> Produced single photons indistinguishability. Typical values lie around 4 Kelvin. Typical operation values lie above 91 %.</li><li><i>Temperature:</i> Cryostat temperature. Typical operation values lie around 4 Kelvin.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the right of the Source module an schematic representation of the micropilar hosting its quantum dot is depicted. On its right, an arrow marks the next step: demultiplexing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Demultiplexer</strong></h2><p>The single photon source used in PhotonQ produced millions of almost identical single photons per second all following the same path. This “train” of photons needs to be redistributed in four different parts, one per each PhotonQ physical qubits.</p><p>The demultiplexer module consists of a photonic setup designed to receive a sequence of photons following the same path and redistribute them into four different paths using. At the core of this photonic demultiplexer an electro-optical modulator serves as the ultrafast optical active element used for redistribution of photons. The source and the demultiplexer module allows PhotonQ users four polarization qubits with high and consistent purity and indistinguishability. At the current version of PhotonQ GUI no controls nor indicators are provided for this module.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/f5cf7f1edd2dd295dcec821682f5d9cb2a9e789d-873x251.png\"></p><p>Once we have the four-qubit photonic system at the demultiplexer output the next step is to prepare the cluster state upon which quantum circuits are implemented. This resource state can be selected in the <i>Cluster State Preparation </i>module.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Cluster State Preparation</strong></h2><p>The <i>Cluster State Preparation </i>module (CSP) allows the configuration of PhotonQ hardware in order to produce a specific cluster state. This state is used as a resource state by PhotonQ to perform a given one-way computation. The CSP module provides two controls (a set of three buttons and a pull-down menu) and two indicators that update upon parameter selection (cluster state in Dirac notation and its graph representation).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/61f11a1543a6f20af25fc1c13c735aee193db862-1726x365.png\"></p><p>The two controls for cluster state preparation appear on the left side of the module below the instructions to use them. These two controls allow any user to configure</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>Number of Qubits:</i> Allows the user to select the number of qubits to be implemented in the photonic quantum computer for the desired computation.</li><li><i>Preset Settings:</i> Allows the user to pick among the different experimental preset conditions that allow the production of the desired cluster states.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once the controls have been used to select the desired cluster state the selected state is shown on Dirac notation on the right side of the CSP module. In addition, the graph representation of the produced cluster state is depicted next to the present setting control. In this graph representation of entangled states consider vertices represent qubits and edges represent entanglement byt account as CZ gates acting on the pairs of qubits that each edge connects.</p><p>For example, the 4-qubit linear cluster (L4) state can be depicted in its graph representation as four vertices in a line connected by edges one after the other completing a full straight line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/593baade8680d5d06251e96b932149739d113f6b-282x99.png\"></p><p>Once the cluster state has been produced, the next step is to use it as a resource to implement the desired computation using the one-way model. For this purpose, after the CSP we have the <i>Qubit Computing </i>module.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Qubit Computing</strong></h2><p>Resource states present entanglement between different qubits within their composition. According to the one-way model, depending on the order we measure these qubits we can implement quantum experiment results that replicates those of quantum circuits, this is the central idea of the one-way model.</p><p>The <i>Qubit Computing (QC) module</i> provides the controls to use the prepared cluster state to implement a specific quantum circuit. It contains three types of controls (switch, multi-option menu, input fields) and one indicator that updates upon parameter selection (circuit model representation of the one-way computation to be performed).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/1bf6dcc17412f45b7257f37b3e2ef25d3257fd40-1726x455.png\"></p><p>The first control provided is an <i>ON-OFF switch</i> that appears on the right side of the module name. It allows turning off PhotonQ one-way quantum computing functionalities. When it is off the qubit computing module is by-passed. This operation mode is useful in order to perform measurements in the four-qubit physical system provided directly by the cluster state preparation module i.e. not using the one-way model. To select this operation mode turn the switch off, then the switch turns gray and no other control nor indicator is displayed in the QC module.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/0570cb2e0e51f3a1987a76f37294c4ee4c35b132-1725x157.png\"></p><p>By clicking the switch again the user can turn on PhotonQ one-way quantum computing functionalities.</p><p>The second control in the QC module uses the graph representation of the cluster state prepared and offers a list of possible configurations compatible with the one-way model. Each of these configurations has a corresponding quantum circuit which can be implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/4bfe63d82272ea94468015db4376515fefcc5752-1444x745.png\"></p><p>By selecting one graph configuration the quantum circuit depicted on the right of the QC module updates accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/2545e4a4c992cd5e05c778b1b87705c46106bbda-1725x396.png\"></p><p>The third control at the QC module is one or more input fields for the angle that serves as a parameter for the qubit rotation implemented in the encoded circuit. Depending on the graph configuration/circuit selected there can be up to three input fields that allow the user to provide three custom angles (named α, β and γ) for different rotations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/86c337c89673f6202a5418494718def6198cc7f1-1722x504.png\"></p><p>Once the circuit and the rotation parameters are specified we are ready to configure the measurements at the output of the encoded circuit. For this purpose, the following module corresponds to qubit measurements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Qubit Measurements</strong></h2><p>The <i>Qubit Measurements (QM) module</i> displays two controls for parameters θ and Φ per qubit free to measure (given by the output of the circuit selected or by the dimension of the cluster state prepared if qubit computing is off) and two indicators.</p><p>An advantage of working with polarization qubits is that single-qubit rotations can be implemented using groups of waveplates. PhotonQ software allows the selection of any custom projection for the encoded qubit as a measurement option. This is done by calculating the appropriate hardware settings in the backend to perform the desired qubit projection on the encoded qubits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/1bcf5fb2c3cedcc60f1855d2a4bc75fc9dc1c201-1727x508.png\"></p><p>In order to specify a given projection to be implemented two parameters per qubit free to measure need to be specified. Input fields are available for each of these parameters to write the angles (in degrees) for the desired measurements. The fixed indicator at the right top side of the module displays the state parameterization using the provided parameters. Below, an indicator of the final part of the circuit is displayed.</p><p>When the qubit computing functionality is off, the number of free qubits displayed correspond to the number of qubits in the cluster state prepared. In this case the circuit indicator updates accordingly and turns into blue to reflect its action on physical qubits and not on encoded ones.</p><p>Once the user parameters have been introduced, the quantum computation request is sent to PhotonQ backend for its execution by clicking on the \"RUN\" button at the bottom right side of the site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/853a72a425e597e7fa5a4c41dc3b0eb63601f3cd-1446x560.jpg\"></p>"}},"IMA:ChoiceField":{"category":{"props":{"name":"category","defaultValue":"All","options":["Beginner","Advanced","All"]},"value":"Beginner"}},"IMA:ImageField":{"mainImage":{"props":{"name":"mainImage","objectFit":"cover","className":"rounded","alt":"Content Image","defaultValue":"https://photonq.at/images/photons.svg"},"value":{"internalImageUrl":"https://osg.snek.at/storage/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ","title":"Lab_Tech_2020_6","alt":"","imageId":"d9de7321-dd18-5a84-8a9e-88d8a6cfc66d"}}}},"jaenPageMetadata":{"title":"How-to PhotonQ","isBlogPost":null,"image":"https://osg.snek.at/storage/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ","description":null,"datePublished":null,"canonical":null},"jaenFiles":[{"id":"d9de7321-dd18-5a84-8a9e-88d8a6cfc66d","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"backgroundColor":"transparent","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/a892d/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/a83d8/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.jpg 750w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/97473/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.jpg 1080w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/a892d/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/67402/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.avif 750w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/e6328/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.avif 1080w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/899f2/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.avif 1200w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/80567/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.webp 750w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/d7295/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.webp 1080w,\n/static/9ce3ad273637e135bfc8da6d02694c2b/83a86/BQACAgQAAxkDAAITAmNELN8isha_TyVXCzwxww78wGKgAALJDQACO-ghUpHHVV1PRd-WKgQ.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":800}}}],"sections":[]}},"pageContext":{"jaenPageId":"JaenPage d7eda767-3b48-4c64-a3a4-5cfd637f287f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2022418099","2766476970","2854131132","3369865175","3753378917","55007266"]}
