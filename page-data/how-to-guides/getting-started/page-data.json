Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n"},"value":"<p>Quantum computing is the next revolution in the IT world and is already appearing very prominently through relevant use cases across all branches of industry in areas such as insurance and finance, chemistry and medicine, cyber security and many others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Classic digital computer logic</strong></h2><p>However, quantum computers process information in a fundamentally different way than we are familiar with from digital computers. In digital computers, the information units are stored in <i>bits </i>that can either have the value <strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>. Physically, bits are nowadays realized with transistors. Electrical circuits with transistors then implement gates that perform boolean logical operations on the bits.</p><p>Examples of classic logic gates are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/6ce7d59000d2b251e8b3d8d5e2e3734c253f78b4-1190x708.png\"></p><blockquote><p><i>Graphic taken from https://instrumentationtools.com/logic-gates/</i></p></blockquote><p><br>Essentially every computation or task in a computer, no matter how complicated, can be traced back to this manipulation of bits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Quantum computing logic</strong></h2><p>Quantum computers, on the other hand, are based on information units in the form of quantum bits, or <i>qubits</i>, which can also be in a superposition, i.e. a linear superposition, of the two states 0 and 1. The states are usually noted like this:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/c00e8a7aaea22fd40361bfbc8ec26db79614517e-423x57.png\"></p><p>where</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/509418c263e9e06ea88e977365cc78d4cddf3bae-338x26.png\"></p><p>with the so-called Dirac notation (the square brackets). With this we make it clear that we no longer only deal with scalars 0 and 1, but with <i>vectors in the Hilbert space</i>.</p><p>The logical operations that a quantum computer performs on qubits are represented by <i>matrices </i>applied to the state vectors.</p><p>Important examples of <i>quantum gates</i> are</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/12b7ff8842cfdf2cd441c45060a96a07e8a7c1cd-681x72.png\"></p><p>In the classic case, for <strong>X</strong> there is the equivalent of the <strong>NOT </strong>gate.</p><p><strong>Y</strong>, <strong>Z</strong> or <strong>H</strong>, on the other hand, have no classical analogue.</p><p>In order to universally represent any quantum algorithm, we still need gates that entangle two qubits with each other. <i>Entanglement </i>is one of the essential ingredients for quantum computing.</p><p>Two prominent examples are <strong>CNOT</strong>, and <strong>CPHASE</strong>:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/e51de2b788aa72eb90d6274cd5b73b1f6d4e9f3f-850x386.png\"></p><blockquote><p><i>Graphic taken from Roy, Pradosh K.. (2020). Quantum Logic Gates.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Quantum circuits</strong></h2><p>By combining appropriate quantum gates, we can build any <i>quantum circuit</i> of our choice.</p><p>A quantum circuit can be represented by a diagram where lines represent the qubits and boxes represent the gates (logical operators on the qubits). The diagram below can be read from left to right. In the following example we see a circuit with 2 qubits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/c6644383c695ab5dfcf99ebaf8ae94a8143df554-636x176.png\"></p><p>We read the circuit from left to right, and so in order it</p><ul><li>performs an <strong>H gate</strong> on the upper qubit in the diagram,</li><li>and then a <strong>CNOT </strong>operation with the upper qubit as control and the second qubit as target.</li></ul><p>Since the two qubits were initialized in the <strong>|0&gt;</strong> state, after executing the two gates <strong>H</strong> and <strong>CNOT </strong>we get the entangled <i>Bell state</i> \"phi plus\":</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/t20b2fns/production/265673f0f1d3ada1ecfa8d816dc52c548eef1cad-242x56.png\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Measuring qubits</strong></h2><p>Another important point is that when we measure qubits, their state vector is projected onto one of the basis vectors <strong>|0&gt;</strong> and <strong>|1&gt;</strong> of the Hilbert space in which the state of the qubit \"lives\". Therefore, when measuring a general state as in eq. (1) we probabilistically obtain the result <strong>|0&gt;</strong> with probability <strong>p(0)</strong> and <strong>|1&gt;</strong> with probability <strong>p(1)</strong>, or when measuring (2) correspondingly the results <strong>|00&gt;</strong> with probability <strong>p(00)</strong> and <strong>|11&gt;</strong> with probability <strong>p(11)</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2><p>Of course, that was just a small pitch to get started.
